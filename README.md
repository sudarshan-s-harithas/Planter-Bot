# Planter-Bot

Planter Bot was Built as a Part of Eyantra Competion. 

 The idea is to
build a robot which is able to traverse the field with good accuracy in path detection
with the aid of vision. The robot traverses a path having different Zones growing
distinct types of plants. Each Zone has an associated requirement for seedlings of a
particular kind to be planted. The robot plants the seedlings as per the requirement in
each Zone which is simulated using image overlay. 

The challenges in this theme include: designing and building a robot with basic
components given, Python programming and Image Processing. Teams get to learn
image processing techniques to overlay images over a given background in real-time.
The team that finishes the given task in the least amount of time whilst incurring the
least penalties is declared the WINNER. 

The detailed description of the task is present in the Rulebook.
