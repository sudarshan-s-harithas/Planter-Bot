# Planter-Bot

Planter Bot was Built as a Part of Eyantra Competion. 

 The idea is to
build a robot which is able to traverse the field with good accuracy in path detection
with the aid of vision. The robot traverses a path having different Zones growing
distinct types of plants. Each Zone has an associated requirement for seedlings of a
particular kind to be planted. The robot plants the seedlings as per the requirement in
each Zone which is simulated using image overlay.
